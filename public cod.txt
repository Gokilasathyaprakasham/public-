# Basic Python Program

# Get user input for their name
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Greet the user
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Get user input for their age
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Display a message based on the age
if age.isdigit():
    age = int(age)
    if age < 18:
        print("You are a minor.")
    else:
        print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("Invalid age input. Please enter a numeric value in the given statement.")
